# yahoo-finance-tracker

This is a program that leverages bs4 and pandas to retrieve data from yahoo finance.

## Installation

Please user the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install this program should come bundled with your
python installation.

Then create a new virtual environment using python's venv, I am using windows in this case

```bash
py -m venv [NAME_OF_VENV]

Activate your virtual environment, again this is windows

```bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
